## I am typing on the Internet ##

I am terrible at blogging, so I figured the best way to overcome this is to dive rught into it. 
Though I'm not sure what to write about, I fugure I'll use it for personal reference to list the steps of some contrived task some good examples being:

* Seperating the data context from an ASP MVC application;
* Rolling my own widget instead of relyung on Bootstrap or jQuery UI - not that I don't like them, I just enjoy the challenge;

Maybe it'll help others who fund themselves in the same situation and Stack Overflow isn't helping. Anyways, here's some stuff:

## Stuff ##

### [Minesweeper-js](http://kuraara.github.io/minesweeper-js) ###
A client side implementation of the classic Minesweeper game. 
Uses jQuery, Handlebars for cell tempkating and some custom css that attempts to emulate the classic Windows 95 UI.

### [Webmo](https://github.com/kuraara/Webmo) ###
An ASP MVC web app, pkayung around with the DAL/Repository pattern which Microsoft recommend as best practise 
*(though using this pattern seem to confluct with ASP Identity and external kogin managment - getting that working 
would be a huge personal achievement)*.
